## 📖 About This Project: Appointment Scheduling application 
I created a GUI-based scheduling desktop application using Java as the programming language. JavaFX and MySQL JDBC Driver were used creating this application. It allows users to schedule appointments, manage customer date, and create reports.
The business hours are 8:00 to 22:00 in Eastern Time Zone (New York). All dates and times are displayed in user's local timezone, however, all dates and times are converted into UTC Standard time zone format by the database driver manager, and saved into the database.
